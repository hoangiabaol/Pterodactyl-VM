## Introduction

**Pterodactyl-VM** is a repository that provides a way to run Alpine Linux "virtual machines" inside Pterodactyl container environments.

> **Original Project:**  
> This project is based on the original script at [RealTriassic/Harbor](https://github.com/RealTriassic/Harbor/blob/main/harbor.sh). I only updated and modified the script to suit my personal use cases.

## Features

- Automates the process of setting up a VM-like environment in Pterodactyl.
- Easy to integrate into existing setups.
- Written in Shell script and works across most Linux environments.

## Requirements

- A server running any Linux distribution.
- Must be hosted within a Pterodactyl container environment.

### Hardware Requirements

- CPU: `x86_64` or `AARCH64` (ARM 64)
- RAM: At least 35MB available
- Storage: At least 40MB free space *(a bit less may still work)*
